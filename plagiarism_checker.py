Python is a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and
simple to implement. It is open source, which means it is free to use, even
for commercial applications. Python can run on Mac, Windows, and Unix systems
and has also been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines.
Python is considered a scripting language, like Ruby or Perl and is often
used for creating Web applications and dynamic Web content.

text_2 = """
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released
in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the
British comedy group Monty Python. Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly
language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because
it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on
fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details.
